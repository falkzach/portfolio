In addition to serving the Computer Science Department as a Teaching Assistant, I was also lucky enough to get to serve the University of Montana Campus by working as a climbing guide and instructor for the <a href="http://www.umt.edu/crec/Outdoor" target="_blank">Outdoor Program</a>.
It was in this capacity that I have been able to share my love of outdoor recreation with other students. In my time here, I have introduced many students to the world of climbing, guided climbing, summits, backpacking trips, and even whitewater rafting.
My time with the Outdoor Program was instrumental in my personal and professional development and highlights the unique opportunities that exist at the University of Montana.

When finishing my undergrad at the University of Montana, I had applied to the graduate program. While I was accepted into the program, I hadn't secured funding as competition for Teaching Assistantships was high, so I hadn't enrolled in classes and didn't plan on attending. After graduation I hopped on a plane to Southern California and spent 3 weeks climbing. I came back, worked my Software Development Job at the University for the last couple months, put out some job apps, but hadn't found a full-time gig yet. A week before school Professor Joel Henry reached out to me and had a last-minute  TA position for me where another student had flaked. I guess I was going to grad school.

I began my first semester of graduate school in the fall of 2016 and it was trying. I had some sudden health problems and underwent a minor surgery to have a sizable benign mass removed from my back. This combined with the equally poor health of a peer resulted in lagged research in a Computational Biology Class; I dropped it to salvage my other classes. First semester in and I'm behind, damn. I did however keep up on my TA duties for Dr. Henry, grading the ethics papers I once dreaded writing.

The following spring semester I TAed the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course for Dr. Travis Wheeler. My duties for this course were intensive. TAing for this class forced me to solidify my understanding of the field to be an effective resource for my students. It was of the utmost importance that I be available to my students as Dr. Wheeler was orchestrating multiple candidate searches during this semester. Despite all this the semester went quite well and finished with excellent marks. I build a Machine Learning tool with friend and colleague David Blasen, took a seminar course exploring Deep Learning, and explored integration techniques for modeling physics in Dr. Jesse Johnson's Simulation and Modeling class. Take that first semester I'm back! The work on miniML lead to working on Machine Learning research for the NTSG and improving the interface of miniML. While a stressful few months, I delivered a robust search to optimize features and parameters for both classical Machine learning models as well as Tensorflow Neural Networks for quantified landsat data.

In the fall of 2017 I began working for the University of Montana Outdoor Program as a Climbing Instructor and Guide. While rock climbing isn't exactly CS related, I feel that maintaining a work life balance is critical to success and working for the ODP, I have the opportunity to share my love for the outdoors with others. It was also this fall that I studied software optimization in C++11 under Dr. Oliver Serang where I developed a true appreciate for the intricacies of the g++ compiler. I also built a Strava Logger (Bike Thing) from a microcontroler and learned some OpenGL. I returned to grading ethics papers this semester, this time for Dr. William Knight. My role was similar to the last time, but I also took great effort to help ensure the ethics class lived up to Dr. Henry's class. I also had the privilege of guiding an awesome group of students on a backpacking trip in Capitol Reef National Park over spring break for the Outdoor Program.

We're in the home stretch here. Entering the program my graduation track was unclear. I'd hoped that the NTSG research could have been the project I graduated on, but it didn't work out that way. Luckily in the back of my head I'd always maintained a full course load knowing I could graduate on this portfolio. Still grading ethics, I'm getting pretty good at these papers and that's where the department needed me. Wish it were algorithms again again. Time to get on with graduation though; had I not dropped comp bio this would be the last semester. I finally got to take a formal Machine Learning class, after many years studying the subject. I studied game physics and built a game in Unity (Another Adventure Game). Pretty cool semester, I'm almost done.

I had to stick around another semester in the fall, I needed one class and I was going to repeat comp bio, fix that mark on my transcript. So, what to do in Missoula for the summer; why not learn to Guide Whitewater Rafting? I was still working for the Outdoor Program and they gave me the chance. So that was my summer: work, raft, work, raft. My first day on the river I 2 paddled massive flood stage wave trains where the rapids were washed out. I was hooked. By the end of the summer I was running friends down the Alberton Gorge and feeling confident on the river.

The final semester. Turns out I must take a second course or else financial aid wants money now. I can play that game, so in addition to repeating Computational Biology I did an independent study of Compilers. I wrote a wicked fast fragment assembler and learned Flex and Bison to build a C++ and most of a straight to x86_64 compiler (I'll eventually fix it). I had some extra free time this semester since I wasn't TAing, and with my recent love for whitewater I learned to kayak this fall too!

Looking back is strange. To be honest I've been putting it off but now that I've retrospected the last couple years a little bit, looking back it was great! I took many interesting courses, studied under great professors and with talented peers, and feel that I had a positive impact on the academic experience of my students. It didn't necessarily feel this way during school. I was stressed, semesters are never long enough, and there were some courses I was much less stoked on. But it was good. I am excited for what is next, whether that is staying in the lovely Missoula Montana or going to a larger city elsewhere. But I'm excited to hit industry, to solve new and challenging problems.

I like to spend my free time in the outdoors and partake in many outdoor recreational activates including Climbing, Mountain Biking, Whitewater Rafting, Backpacking and this fall even learned to Kayak. 
Sometimes I have the privilege of sharing my passion for the outdoors with others through guiding. During my time attending Graduate School at the University of Montana, I've enjoyed working for the <a href="https://www.umt.edu/crec/Outdoor" target="_blank">Outdoor Program</a>, one of the unique features of our campus.
I currently hold an <a href="https://amga.com/" target="_blank">AMGA</a> Climbing Wall Instructor Lead Certification and hold a current Wilderness First Responder Certification from <a href="https://aeriemedicine.com" target="_blank">AEIRE Backcountry Medicine</a>. I intent to peruse the AMGA Single Pitch Instructor and Wilderness EMT certifications.
